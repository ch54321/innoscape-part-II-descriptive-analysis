The Swiss pharmaceutical sector has a major impact on Switzerland’s economy and the well-being of its citizens in general. It is a true example of a world-class innovation hub and is one of the industry’s global leaders when it comes to R&D activities. Nonetheless, one of the concerns, often pointed out in public, is whether the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland will be able to overcome the rising challenges of a vibrant environment in which it operates and will it be able to retain its top position in the future. In this report, we revisit how it has evolved and discuss its current importance for the whole economy, laying grounds for our upcoming set of analyses on how to strengthen innovation capacities of Swiss pharmaceutical firms in the future.

Today, the pharmaceutical industry directly employs around 33’000 individuals with permanent residency in Switzerland. Furthermore, around 7 thousand cross-border commuters work in the Swiss pharma sector. The interactive graph below illustrates absolute and relative employment figures in the pharmaceutical industry across different countries. Although the absolute numbers may seem to be low, the share of employees in the Swiss pharmaceutical sector in total number of employed individuals is two times larger compared to those of the USA, Germany, France or Italy. Interestingly, the share of employment in the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland is similar to Belgium, but the Swiss workers are creating a much higher economic impact than their Belgium colleagues suggesting extraordinary high productivity levels.

Data are taken from <a href = https://ilostat.ilo.org/data/ target = “_blank”>ILOSTAT</a> database (Accessed 28-07-2020). Employment data comes from the local labor force surveys which cover only the resident population. This means that the employment figures do not cover cross-border commuters. In addition, given that an employed person may hold several jobs the employment refers to his or her primary job only. Finally, this data covers all persons of working age who, during a specified brief period, were either in paid employment or self-employed.

<br>


Even with such a "low" number of employed persons, the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland is generating an immense added value for the Swiss economy. This implies a very high level of labor productivity relative to other manufacturing industries (even taking into account the large number of cross-border commuters employed in the sector, see [cite lab_productivity_output]). Hence, in recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has contributed substantially to the Swiss welfare, accounting for more than 5% of the total gross value added in the economy (see <a href = https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/catalogues-databases/tables.assetdetail.9546430.html target = “_blank”>Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland - National Accounts database, accessed 15-09-2020</a>). However, the true rise of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry has only begun after the year 2000, when it overpassed the two other big Swiss industries – manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products, which also includes the world-famous Swiss watches; and manufacture of machinery and equipment (n.e.c.).

Data are taken from several sources: GVA data from the <a href = https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/catalogues-databases/tables.assetdetail.9546430.html target = “_blank”>Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland</a> - National Accounts database (accessed 15-09-2020); labor force survey data on the number of employees from <a href = https://ilostat.ilo.org/data/ target = “_blank”>ILOSTAT</a> database (accessed 28-07-2020); firms survey data on the number of jobs from <a href = https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/pxweb/en/px-x-0602000000_101/px-x-0602000000_101/px-x-0602000000_101.px target = “_blank”>Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland</a> (accessed 12-08-2020); and data on cross-border workers from <a href = https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/pxweb/de/px-x-0302010000_106/px-x-0302010000_106/px-x-0302010000_106.px target = “_blank”>Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland</a> database (accessed 19-08-2020).

<a href = https://www.media-stat.admin.ch/web/apps/glossary/index.php?n=glo-165-en target = “_blank”>FSO</a> explanation: "The term “jobs” refers to all positions of employment that are filled. While largely covering the same concept, "jobs" and "employed persons" do not always coincide, given that an employed person may hold several jobs. In such cases, the employed person holds one primary job and one or more secondary jobs." In addition, ILO data on employment covers only the residents given that it is collected via local labor force surveys. We utilize this differences to create three different labor productivity indicators, primarily by assuming that ILO employment data represents a good approximation for jobs held by Swiss residents.

<br>

The fact that less than 1% of the labor force generates more than 5% of value added is remarkable and deserves more attention. Obviously, the following question arises: How dependent is the Swiss pharmaceutical sector’s high productivity on foreign workers, especially on cross-border commuters? In order to illustrate this, we present three productivity estimates that use different definitions of the number of employees: (a) workers with residence in Switzerland, (b) total number of jobs and (c) workers with residence in Switzerland + cross-border commuters. We define the labor productivity for each sector as the gross value added (GVA) in CHF per worker.
The labor productivity in the pharmaceutical sector varies heavily depending on the used definition of workers. Taking into account the cross-border commuters, the productivity estimates drop by roughly 30% and when considering the total number of jobs, it drops by nearly 40% compared to calculations that use the Swiss residents only. This highlights the fact that the Swiss pharmaceuticals' performance is substantially dependent on the foreign labor force. However, regardless of the indicator used, the labor productivity of the pharmaceutical industry is by far the highest among Swiss manufacturing sectors. More insight on how cross-border workers affect the innovation processes in Switzerland can be found in our report: Cross-border commuting and inventions 'Made in Switzerland' (cite Matthias output).

### The market for pharmaceuticals is global 

<br>

Access to skilled labor from abroad is important but free international trade may be even more significant for the growth of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry. The market for pharmaceutical products is global and the home-market is limited in its size, thus the Swiss pharmaceutical firms are required to nurture their export activities. Although Swiss pharma export figures are rising steadily in the last 30 years, there are some potential caveats concerning these export trends. For example, back in 1990, pharmaceutical products comprised less than 10% of the total Swiss exports to most destinations. Yet, in 2019 the share of pharma exports made up almost 30 % of the total exported goods in most of destination countries, making the overall Swiss export performance increasingly dependable on a single sector. Furthermore, the geographical dispersion of export destinations is also changing. In 1990 around 8 % of total Swiss pharma exports went to the USA, while in 2019 this share was roughly 26%. On the one hand, a larger export orientation towards the USA (and Germany) could produce certain concentration risks. But on the other, it may reveal important geographical innovation patterns and collaborations in facilitating new approaches in future research. In other words, the flow of pharmaceutical products may trail the flow of knowledge (more on this topic in our report on inventors’ nationalities - coming out soon).

### Swiss Pharma: A world class innovator 

<br>

"The core task of research-based pharmaceutical companies is to combat disease by developing innovative medicinal products and to make these medicines available to patients as quickly as possible" <a href = https://www.interpharma.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low_interpharma_broschure_A4_rz_en_DS_compressed.pdf target = “_blank”>(Interpharma, p.9)</a>. Hence, innovation is key in the pharmaceutical sector and, protecting intellectual property is an important aspect of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry's R&D activity. According to Dr. Severin Schwan (CEO, Roche) without patents there would be no innovation in the pharmaceutical sector (Interview in <a href =  https://www.adlittle.com/sites/default/files/prism/Interview_with_Severin_Schwan.pdf target = “_blank”>Prism, 2013</a>). In the scientific literature, patents are often used as a proxy for innovation and as a metric for deriving knowledge flows (see the scientific collaboration network of the pharmaceutical industry below). Even though being an imperfect measure, they still represent a standardized measure in evaluating knowledge diffusions and innovation effectiveness (for a recent literature survey please see: <a href = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obes.12365 target = “_blank”>Arvanitis, Seliger and Wörter, 2020</a>).



The Swiss pharmaceutical sector is often denoted as “one of the most important centers of pharmaceutical research world-wide, with a reputation that reaches far beyond Europe” (<a href = https://www.interpharma.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low_interpharma_broschure_A4_rz_en_DS_compressed.pdf target = “_blank”>Interpharma, p.7</a>). However, the number of published patents in the pharmaceutical sector in Switzerland is slowly losing its pace after 2008, a trend also visible in many other countries. In addition, during the same period the share of pharma patents in total patent applications is also declining, from 10% in 2008 to below 5% in 2015, which indicates that, relative to other industries, the Swiss pharmaceutical sector lost some of its importance for the overall domestic innovation activity. Note, however, that these figures represent patent counts, which are quantitative measures of innovation. In turn, these measures can’t say much about the quality and importance of new inventions in different sectors. Nonetheless its relative decline, the pharmaceutical sector still remains highly ranked when it comes to the innovation intensity in total patent applications. Switzerland has also a very high revealed comparative advantage in creating pharma patents (among top 3 countries world-wide), meaning that it possesses a particular strength in pharmaceutical innovations compared to the rest of the world. Interestingly, Spain is positioning itself as the world-leader according to the RCA index. Spanish patenting intensity was more resilient to the 2008 crisis than the Swiss, implying that in the future we may expect the rise of pharmaceutical industries in other countries, even among those considered as untraditional pharma hubs. This could make the overall competition in the world healthcare market even harsher.

Patent data for US patents are taken from <a https://www.patentsview.org/download/ target = “_blank”>patentsview.org</a> (considers data till August 27, 2020) and for EPO patents from the  <a http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/intellectual-property-statistics-and-analysis.htm target = “_blank”>OECD intellectual property (IP) statistics and analysis database</a> (considers data till January, 2020). Absolute values are pharmaceutical patent counts for each country, where the inventor’s residence determines the patent’s geographical affiliation. In case of more inventors from different countries, the geographical division is assigned and then summed as shares. For example, if one inventor comes from the USA and the other from Japan, the same patent will be assigned as 0.5 to USA and 0.5 to Japan (for more information on how to determine the origins of patents see GRENZGÄNGER-OUTPUT).

"% in Total patents" represents the share of pharmaceutical patents in total patent applications across each country.

<br>

"RCA" in Pharma patents represents the so-called "revealed comparative advantage" in patenting pharmaceutical products. It is the share of pharmaceutical patents in total country’s patents divided by the share of total world pharmaceutical patents in total world patents. It thus represents a measure of international innovativeness of an industry relative to the entire economy of a country.

If the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland wants to maintain and improve its current high levels of innovation, international connectivity and access to global knowledge might be crucial. These aspects are what we examine next. We derive technological (or inter-sectoral) connectivity of Swiss pharmaceutical innovations from patent citations. Below we present the so-called backward citations of the Swiss pharmaceutical patents across different technologies (see methodological explanations below for more details). These citations show what technological fields are important for developing new patents in the Swiss pharmaceutical sector.

<br>

### Citations

<br>

In the early 90s, new Swiss pharma patent applications draw knowledge from a very limited number of “traditional” fields (biotechnology, organic chemistry, medical technology and measurement) and in a very limited scope. Hence, at this time innovation in the pharmaceutical sector was not much dependent on knowledge flows from other technologies abroad. However, since the late 1990s the international citation network of Swiss pharma patents started its rapid growth in terms of both the extensive (number of different fields) and intensive margin (number of citations per field), reaching its peak in 2008. The citation network expended to even include some “untraditional” sectors (for example textiles and paper machines and furniture, games) but also those related to “new technology fields (telecommunications, computer technology, IT methods for management) depicting the ongoing fast-paced changes led by digitalization, fundamentally impacting pharmaceutical R&D activities. After 2008, however, there is a clear tendency of shrinking of the collaboration network to its early 90s levels. This trend coincides with previously mentioned overall deceleration in patenting activity in the Swiss pharmaceutical industry (cite Dragan patent output).

### Main take-aways

<br>

* Employment shares of the domestic labor force in the Swiss pharma sector is two times larger than in the USA, Germany, France or Italy

* Less than 1% of the labor force generates more than 5% of Swiss GDP

* Taking into account the cross-border commuters the productivity estimates drop by 30%

* In 2019, 30 % of the Swiss exports are pharmaceutical products and 26% of the total Swiss pharma exports goes to the USA

* The number of patents is declining, but the Swiss pharmaceuticals are among the top 3 countries world-wide in patent applications relative to its size

* After an intensive expansion until 2008, the international citation network of Swiss pharma innovations is rapidly shrinking
